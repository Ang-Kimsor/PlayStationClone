  <h1 align="center">🎮 PlayStation Clone 🎮</h1>
  <p align="center">
    This is a recreation of the original PlayStation One homepage, bringing back those classic 90s gaming vibes.  
    You can check out the old-school layout, menus, and game previews just like on the real site.  
    It’s designed to look and feel authentic, with all the retro fonts and colors.  
    The site works smoothly on both desktop and mobile, so you can enjoy the nostalgia anywhere.  
    It’s a fun little project for anyone who loves vintage gaming or wants to practice building pixel-perfect designs.  
    Navigating the site feels just like the original, simple and straightforward.  
    It’s a cool way to see how you can use modern web tools to recreate old-school styles.  
    This isn’t a real store or functional site, but it nails the look and feel perfectly.  
    If you’re a PlayStation fan or just love retro web design, this project is for you.  
    A nice throwback and a solid portfolio piece showing attention to detail.
